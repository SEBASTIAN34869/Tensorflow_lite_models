The following file contains YoloV7 model and its configuration files:

The files are needed for yolov7 transfer learning in custom model as well as standard 80 class detection.
The current file however used for custom model training and only has class upto 1.

However with some minute changes in the configuration classes files and dataset location, this project can used to train any detection model with suitable GPU.

The primarily used of yolov7 model I used with Google Colab with Tesla T4 GPU .
